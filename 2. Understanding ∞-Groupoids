§ Understanding ∞-Groupoids

Groupoid is an abstract algebraic notion for a collection of labeled connections that can be composed chainwise as long as source type of each connection in chain matches the target type of the next one, and are invertible. That is, a groupoid is a category where all transitions are invertible. Groupoids naturally arise as connectomes of graphs and as encodings for an action of a group on a space. More broad ∞-groupoids arise as connectomes of generic spaces and encode the generic notion of a space with inherent symmetries.

§ Connectome of a space.
By  𝕀  we will denote the real interval, the (unique up to homeomorphism) universal topological space with distinct points called "ends" which is  homeomorphic to two copies of itself glued end to end[#Freyd99].

Let  S  be a topological space. We'll call continuous images of  𝕀  to  S  paths, for two points  a b ∈ S,  let  (a ~ b)  denote the topological space of paths from  a  to  b, the presence or absence of elements in (a ~ b) tells if  a  and  b  belong to the same path-connected component of  S.  For any two paths x y ∈ (a ~ b) we can again define that space of paths (x ~ y), these correspond to "membranes" with two vertices (a and b) and two edges (x and y) in the original space S. We can define branes of any finite order, their properties reveal the structure of holes and junctions in the space S. For a topological space that can be embedded into a plane, the whole structure of holes and junctions is visible already on the second level, because membranes cannot avoid holes by "going above or below" it. For three-dimensional manifolds we'll need to go at least to the third order and so on.

Note that for any point  a  we can define the trivial path (𝕀 :x ↦ a) ∈ (x ~ x), paths are invertible and for any  a b c ∈ S, there is a composition map (a ~ b) × (b ~ c) -> (a ~ c) and the composition. If it were associative, the structure (S, _~_) would be a groupoid, but it's not exactly the case.

Composition is only nearly associative, which means that depending on the execution order the resulting curves (ab)c and a(bc) vary, but are still connected by a canonical path in ((ab)c ~ a(bc)) called associator. Unlike in the case of exact equality, for assuring that composition of more than three paths is order independent we'll also need higher associators (i.e. associators of paths between associators), so in order to fix the structure, we need to state associativity axioms for compositions of any finite length (i.e. a countable family of commutative diagrams). A structure of this kind with associativity axioms for any given finite length is called ∞-groupoid.

It's not hard to define a groupoid along these lines:
Recall that a (finite) commutative diagram is just a category: it has a finite set of labeled objects and a finite set of labeled morphisms between them. Realization of a commutative diagram is just a functor from this category to somewhere else: it means, for every labelled object the functor selects an object in the target category, for every labeled morphism it selects a morphism in the target category, the commutativity of the diagram is guaranteed by the functoriality. The categories representing commutative diagrams for associativity of n-ary composition are the n-truncated simplicial categories (objects of those are finite ordered sets, arrows are inverses of order preserving functions), so we only have to say that ∞-groupoid is a simultaneous functor from all truncated simplicial categories, or, equivalently, it is a functor from (untruncated) simplicial category satisfying the condition that it can be truncated to any finite level coherently: this is famously known as the Kan condition.

An excellent treatment of the subject is available in:

The above construction allows us to defined a fundamental ∞-groupoid of the space S (also called <b>connectome of the space</b> for it reveals all the connectedness-related properties of the space). Most naturally occuring topological spaces (say, a sphere or a plane) have uncountable numbers of points, uncountable number of paths etc, but by identifying the equivalent points, paths, branes etc., we an equivalent ∞-groupoid (called so called "skeleton" of the original one), mostly with a finite or at least enumerable sets of elements at every level. For example a circle has only one generic point (for it has one connected component) and the set of paths between this point and itself can be identified to the set of integer numbers with addition as composition.

The major motivation for studying connectomes (and especially their skeletons, which is what combinatorial algebraic topology does) arises from the fact that almost all algebraic properties* of spaces depend only on its connectome.

There are lots of other ways to define ∞-groupoid all of which are equivalent to the above one assuming Law of Excluded middle. When working constructively, definitions are not completely equivalent anymore for some of them contain less computational content than the others, in particular, the definition based on simplicial sets leaves information on degeneracy of certain fillers implicit so that some composition operations cannot be implemented algorithmically, unless we have an omnicient oracle able to check infinite amount of information in finite time. The definition based on cubical sets keep explicit track of this information, so that composition remain feasible algorithmically.

[* Exception is formed by properties related to compactness structure.]

§ infGroupoids as sets with inner symmetries.

Very often we need to consider quotients of a space or a set by the action of some group. For example finite collections (i.e. finite multisets) are precisely quotients of lists by the group of all permutations. Cycles are lists modulo shifts. Symmetric binary trees are binary trees modulo hereditary swaps. Considering quotient sets just as sets of equivalence classes hides relevant information, it is much better to consider them as sets with inherent symmetries, i.e. for any two elements of the set there should be a (possibly empty) set (a ~ b) of symmetries transforming a to b. The set is nonempty iff a and b belong to the same equivalence class, and the structure of these sets whenever they are nonempty reveal the group structure of internal symmetries of this equivalence class.

For example, real circle is the quotient of the real line by the action of the group Z by translations, and periodic functions are precisely the functions on real line that respect the action of this group. Respecting, however doesn't always mean that the function yields literally _same_ results when shifted by its period: it might also be that the range of the function is a set with internal symmetries itself, and action of the internal symmetry on the domain set of the function induces internal symmetry in the range set.

Since set of internal symmetries of the set with internal symmetries can have internal symmetries itself, we the notion of such sets is codified correctly by infty grouppoids and not the simple ones.

Working with inftyGroupoids instead of sets all the time (that's what the univalent foundations programme is essentially about) and asking for equality up to homotopic equivalence of instead of literal equality seems to be always beneficial, since all correct mathematical concepts and properties are invariant with respect to it, and on the other hand, structures defined this way are richer. Higher generalization of combinatorial species suddenly includes combinatorics of feynman diagrams and string diagrams, higher generalization of manifolds naturally leads to gauge field theories (which are known to be fundamental in physics), higher generalization of algebraic varieties includes moduli spaces.

Along these lines one can also define ∞-categories, where all the properties hold only "up to homotopy equivalence", see http://sma.epfl.ch/~finster/infcats/ for an accessible introduction. Ultimately it also leads to the theory of infiniti-topoi and homotopic algebraic geometry, which is the ultimate generalization of algebraic geometry known to date. Unfortunatelly, there are no accesible introductory cources on this topics. The monographies of Jacob Lurie and the giantic Stacks project book are the only comprehencive sources about them.
